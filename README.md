# Foolproof-snake-game

If you're reading this, I'm sure you're familiar with the classic snake game. 

The game is simple, you have a snake that keeps moving, and you have to change its direction using arrow keys. 
The snake eats food that spawns on the screen to grow longer by 1 unit. 
The snake dies if it runs into its own body.
In some versions of the game, the snake dies if it runs into the boundary of the screen as well, but in others, if the snake exits the screen from the one end, it enters from the opposite end.

Till here, we're all on the same page but have you ever felt frustrated playing this game for a long time, getting the snake to an impressive length, but then your big snake crashes into itself because you took a wrong turn or ran out of space?
Well have I got some good news for you!

This snake follows a fixed Hamiltonian path, passing through each and every point on the screen, ensuring it always eats the food and never runs into anything. This snake will grow until it's the size of the screen.

Truly a foolproof snake game. So sit back, relax, and watch the snake that starts out small, gradually get bigger!
